# Kotlin Tasklist for Terminals
## Implementing a daily task list TUI

A project which implements a task-list for terminals, with simple TUI menu which allows the user to choose different options.

Allows the user to:

1) Add Tasks by number (i.e. 1 - Dentist)
2) Add current date and time for tasks (i.e. 1 2023-11-11 11:33)
3) Add a task priority (i.e. 1 2023-11-11 11:33 C (for Critical))
 
Work in progress.
