# Kotlin Tasklist for Terminals
## Implementing a daily task list TUI

A project which implements a task-list for terminals, with simple TUI menu which allows the user to choose different options.

Allows the user to:

1) Add Tasks by number (i.e. 1 - Dentist)
2) Add current date and time for tasks (i.e. 1 2023-11-11 11:33)
3) Add a task priority (i.e. 1 2023-11-11 11:33 C (for Critical))
4) Edit every aspect of the created task, from date to rewriting the task itself.

The program will also attach a 'due-date-tag' to the top of the task, next to date/time, to indicate whether the task is overdue or ontime.
 
Work in progress.
